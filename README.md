# 1. Product Recommendation System
This project implements a Product Recommendation System using Python and the NumPy library. The recommendation system uses a basic approach based on cosine similarity to suggest products to users based on their preferences and interactions with other products.

# Technologies Used : 
1. Python
Primary programming language used to implement the recommendation system. Python is known for its simplicity and efficiency in handling data manipulation, machine learning, and data science tasks.
2. NumPy
A powerful library for numerical operations in Python. It is used for matrix operations and linear algebra, which are essential for calculating similarities between products and generating recommendations.
3. Cosine Similarity
The algorithm used to measure the similarity between two products based on user interaction. This metric is ideal for sparse data (like user ratings) and helps in identifying products that are most similar to each other.
